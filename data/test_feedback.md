### Brand Assets (what exists)

**Visual identity:**
- Logo: Have it, multiple formats (Sarah shared Figma link)
- Colors: Primary blue (#2563EB), secondary purple (#7C3AED), accent yellow (#FBBF24)
- Typography: Inter for UI, Outfit for marketing
- Photography style: "Authentic workplace moments, diverse, not stocky" (their words)
- Illustration style: Semi-abstract, geometric, they have some but not a full system

**Brand voice (from their internal doc, very rough):**
> "TechFlow is the smart friend who actually knows what they're talking about. Not condescending, not overly casual. We're confident but not arrogant. We use humor sparingly and appropriately. We're direct - we don't waste people's time with fluff."

No formal brand guidelines doc exists. Need to create one or work from above.

**Existing content assets:**
- 12 blog posts (mixed quality)
- 2 case studies (Calm, one agency - both need refreshing)
- Product demo video (8 min, dated, pre-FlowAI)
- Webinar recordings (4, mostly sales-led)
- Sales deck (constantly changing)
- Some social graphics (inconsistent)

## Part 2: Competitor Deep Dive

### Competitor A: monday.com

**The behemoth we pretend isn't there**

**Company facts:**
- Founded: 2012 (Tel Aviv)
- Public: NASDAQ since 2021
- Market cap: ~$10B (as of Nov 2024, down from peak of $15B)
- Employees: 1,800+
- Revenue: ~$800M ARR (growing ~30% YoY, slowing)

**Product positioning:**
"Work OS" - they've tried to become everything. PM, CRM, dev tools, marketing management. Jack of all trades criticism is real but they have the resources to throw at it.

**Pricing:**
| Tier | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Free | $0 | Up to 2 seats, very limited |
| Basic | $9/seat/mo | Misleading, most need Standard |
| Standard | $12/seat/mo | Where most start |
| Pro | $19/seat/mo | Automation, integrations |
| Enterprise | Custom | Usually $25-35/seat |

Minimums apply on some tiers. Pricing widely criticized as confusing.

**Marketing approach:**
- MASSIVE brand spend - TV, podcast, YouTube everywhere
- Celebrity/influencer partnerships
- Very aggressive retargeting (borderline annoying)
- Strong PLG motion but supported by huge sales team
- Content marketing machine (blog, templates, courses)
- Their G2 review game is aggressive (incentivized reviews?)

**Recent activity:**
- Launched "monday AI" (October 2024) - similar feature set to FlowAI
- Acquired automation startup in Q3
- Pushing hard into CRM space (monday Sales CRM)
- New brand campaign with that orange color everywhere

**Strengths:**
- Brand awareness - everyone knows them
- Resources to out-spend anyone
- Wide product surface (something for everyone)
- Good template library
- Strong SMB motion

**Weaknesses:**
- Seen as "basic" or "just for marketing teams"
- Complexity creep - trying to be everything
- Pricing confusion
- AI features perceived as "me too" not innovative
- Less technical credibility (not great for eng-adjacent teams)

**How TechFlow wins against them:**
Per sales team: Focus on the AI being actually useful (not just checkboxes), better for tech companies specifically, cleaner UX, more transparent pricing. Mid-market buyers often find monday "grew past them" - features they need are locked behind Enterprise.

---

### Competitor B: Asana

**The "professional" choice**

**Company facts:**
- Founded: 2008 (by Facebook co-founder)
- Public: NYSE since 2020
- Market cap: ~$3B (rough times, down from $7B)
- Employees: 1,600+
- Revenue: ~$650M ARR

**Product positioning:**
"Work management" - more structured than monday, targets serious teams. Strong in enterprise, weaker in SMB. Product is legitimately good but feels dated to some.

**Pricing:**
| Tier | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Personal | $0 | Up to 15 users, surprisingly generous |
| Starter | $11/user/mo | New tier, SMB focus |
| Advanced | $25/user/mo | Where the features are |
| Enterprise | Custom | $35-50/user typically |
| Enterprise+ | Custom | Big co stuff |

**Marketing approach:**
- More B2B traditional - webinars, content, events
- Strong analyst relations (Gartner, Forrester presence)
- "Anatomy of Work" reports - thought leadership angle
- Less splashy than monday, more sophisticated positioning
- Partner ecosystem push (Salesforce, ServiceNow integrations)

**Recent activity:**
- "Asana Intelligence" launched mid-2024 (AI rebrand)
- Goals feature getting more attention
- Struggling with growth narrative (stock down)
- New CEO as of 2024, some strategic shifts expected
- Workforce management acquisitions rumored

**Strengths:**
- Enterprise credibility
- Sophisticated feature set
- Strong with larger teams
- Good analyst positioning
- Integration depth

**Weaknesses:**
- Expensive for what you get
- UI feels dated to younger users
- Mobile experience meh
- AI features not differentiated
- Slowing growth = less innovation?

**How TechFlow wins against them:**
Per sales: Price/value proposition, AI features that "just work", better for mid-market (Asana tries to upsell to Enterprise), more modern UX. Technical teams often find Asana "too project manager-y."

---

### Competitor C: ClickUp

**The chaotic feature factory**

**Company facts:**
- Founded: 2017
- Private, last valued at $4B (2021, probably down)
- Employees: ~1,000
- Revenue: Estimated $150-200M ARR (they don't disclose)

**Product positioning:**
"One app to replace them all" - they literally have this on their site. Ship features at insane pace. Kitchen sink approach. Some love it, some find it overwhelming.

**Pricing:**
| Tier | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Free Forever | $0 | Actually usable |
| Unlimited | $7/member/mo | Wild value |
| Business | $12/member/mo | Most features |
| Enterprise | Custom | Usually $15-20 |

Extremely aggressive pricing. Race to bottom vibes but it works for them.

**Marketing approach:**
- Heavy SEM/paid social
- Comparison pages for EVERY competitor (including TechFlow, yes we've seen it)
- YouTube presence (tutorials, comparisons)
- Community/ambassador program
- G2 optimization (SO many reviews)
- Very active on Twitter/X, sometimes drama-starting

**Recent activity:**
- ClickUp Brain (AI) launched early 2024
- Docs product improving
- Whiteboards feature
- Universal Search
- Lots of features, hard to keep track

**Strengths:**
- Value proposition is real (lots for cheap)
- Feature parity/superiority in many areas
- Good for technical users who like customization
- Growing fast (reportedly)
- Young, hungry culture

**Weaknesses:**
- "Jack of all trades, master of none"
- Performance issues (app can be slow)
- Overwhelming for new users
- Quality concerns (features half-baked)
- Support mixed reviews
- Company culture concerns (Glassdoor)

**How TechFlow wins against them:**
Per sales: Quality over quantity positioning, FlowAI is better than ClickUp Brain, "we do fewer things but do them right", enterprise-ready (ClickUp struggles with compliance/security), onboarding that doesn't require a PhD.

---

### Competitor D: Notion

**The darling that pivoted**

**Company facts:**
- Founded: 2013
- Private, last valued at $10B (2021 round)
- Employees: ~500
- Revenue: Estimated $250-350M ARR

**Product positioning:**
Started as notes/docs, now "connected workspace." Not traditional PM tool but keeps expanding there. Very design-forward.

**Pricing:**
| Tier | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Free | $0 | Generous for personal |
| Plus | $10/user/mo | Small teams |
| Business | $15/user/mo | Most use cases |
| Enterprise | Custom | $20-25 range |

**Why they matter:**
They're not exactly a competitor but customers use them AS a competitor (Notion for PM is common). The AI features are good (Notion AI was early). Strong brand affinity especially with younger users/companies.

**Strengths:**
- Beautiful product
- Flexibility
- Strong brand love
- Notion AI is decent
- Great templates ecosystem

**Weaknesses:**
- Not a "real" PM tool
- Database performance at scale
- Enterprise feature gaps
- Security/compliance catching up

**TechFlow vs Notion:**
Different use case really but we hear "we use Notion" in sales calls. Usually need to show them what they're missing (resource planning, time tracking, reporting) vs what Notion can hack together.

---

### Competitor E: Wrike

**The enterprise stalwart**

**Company facts:**
- Founded: 2006
- Acquired by Citrix (2021), then Vista Equity (2023)
- Employees: ~1,000
- Revenue: Estimated $300-400M ARR

**Product positioning:**
Enterprise work management. Complex, powerful, expensive. Adobe of PM tools.

**Pricing:**
Most expensive in category
- Team: $10/user/mo (limited)
- Business: $25/user/mo
- Enterprise: $30-50/user/mo
- Pinnacle: $50+/user/mo (new tier)

**Why they matter:**
Target different segment (enterprise) but we run into them in larger mid-market deals. Their AI (Wrike AI) is enterprise-focused. Good to understand but not primary competitor.

                         |
                        SMB
```

**TechFlow's position:** Mid-market sweet spot, complexity in the middle, differentiated by AI that actually works and the resource planning + time tracking combo.

## Part 3: This Campaign Brief

### What We Know

**Campaign Name:** TBD (working title: "Flow Forward" or "Work Smarter with AI" - neither great)

**Budget:** $250,000 total
- Media: ~$180K (72%)
- Creative production: $40K (16%)
- Agency fees: $30K (12%) ← this might not be accurate, need to confirm

**Timeline:**
- Planning/creative: Now through Jan 2025
- Launch: February 1, 2025
- Duration: 3 months (Feb-Apr)
- Q2 decision point based on Q1 performance

**Primary goal:** 500 MQLs (marketing qualified leads)

**Secondary goals (from Sarah's email, unclear priority):**
- Brand awareness lift (how do we measure this?)
- Sales enablement content
- Establish FlowAI thought leadership
- "Something for Product Hunt if we launch 2.0" (???)

**Target audience:** Mid-market companies, 50-500 employees, US primary
- Decision makers: Ops leads, PMO, sometimes IT
- Influencers: Team leads, PMs, department heads
- Verticals: Tech and professional services primarily

**Geographic focus:**
- Primary: United States
- Secondary: UK, Canada, Australia
- Explicitly NOT: EU (GDPR concerns with current setup), APAC (no sales coverage)

### Customer Research (raw notes from Marcus call Nov 3)

*Why do people buy TechFlow? (his words)*

"Usually it's one of three things. One, they've outgrown whatever free tool they started with - Trello, basic Asana, Notion databases - and they need actual project management. Two, they're using multiple tools and hate it - PM in Asana, time tracking in Harvest, resource planning in spreadsheets - and they want one thing. Three, and this is newer, they heard about our AI and want to see if it's real."

*Who makes the decision?*

"Depends on company size. 50-150, usually ops person or head of PM. 150-300, might be a VP of Ops or COO type. 300+, could be IT or procurement involved. We've seen buying committees of 1 person and buying committees of 8."

*What do they say in sales calls?*

"They ask about integrations first always. Then pricing. Then they want a demo of the AI. The AI demo is where we close deals - when people see Ask Flow answer a real question about their test project, you can see the lightbulb."

*What are the objections?*

"Security and compliance for bigger ones. For mid-market it's usually 'we don't have time to migrate' or 'the team won't adopt another tool.' Price occasionally but less than you'd think - our price is fair for what you get. Sometimes 'we're already in monday/Asana and it's fine' which is hard to counter."

### Campaign Requirements/Constraints

**From client kickoff (Nov 5):**
- No mentioning specific competitors by name in ads (legal's request)
- Healthcare vertical content needs compliance review
- All creative needs Marcus or Sarah sign-off
- Lead form must integrate with HubSpot
- Landing pages should use existing TechFlow design system if possible
- Weekly performance reports required
- Monthly strategy calls with leadership

**Things we can do:**
- Create new landing pages
- Develop any creative formats
- Target any channels (within reason)
- Use customer logos (with individual approval)
- A/B test messaging and creative

**Things we can't do:**
- Price promotions or discounts (margins already tight)
- Claims about competitor weaknesses directly
- Promise features that aren't GA
- Use customer names without explicit approval
- Anything that touches EU users for now

## Part 4: Information Gaps & Follow-Up Questions

### What We Still Need to Know

After reviewing all materials, there are critical gaps that prevent developing effective brand positioning:

**Gap 1: The "Why TechFlow" Story**

We have feature lists and competitive data, but what's the REAL reason someone should choose TechFlow over alternatives? The sales team says "AI that works" and "all-in-one" but these are also monday's and ClickUp's claims.

Need to understand:
- What specific moment in the product makes customers say "wow"?
- What's the promise we can make that competitors can't?
- Is there a founder story or origin angle worth exploring?

**Gap 2: Who Is The Real Buyer?**

We have rough segments but no actual personas. "Ops leads, PMO, sometimes IT" is too vague for targeting and messaging.

Need to understand:
- One specific job title we're optimizing for
- Their daily pain that TechFlow solves
- What they care about (career, efficiency, looking good to boss?)
- Where they spend time online

**Gap 3: What Success Looks Like**

500 MQLs is a number but what makes an MQL qualified? What happens after?

Need to understand:
- MQL criteria (form fill? Demo request? Something else?)
- Sales team capacity (can they handle 500 leads in 3 months?)
- Target cost per MQL (related to budget math)
- What % of MQLs typically convert?

---

### Follow-Up Questions

Based on the gaps above, we need answers to these questions before proceeding with positioning:

**Question 1: The Positioning Choice**

Looking at the competitive landscape, TechFlow could position as:

A) **The AI-First PM Tool** - Lead with FlowAI as the core differentiator, accept that competitors will catch up but we're ahead now

B) **The Mid-Market Sweet Spot** - Not as complex as Wrike/Asana Enterprise, not as basic as monday/ClickUp. Right-sized for growing companies.

C) **The Unified Platform** - Stop juggling PM + time tracking + resource planning. One tool that does all three well.

Each has trade-offs. Which resonates most with your vision and what sales is hearing?

**Question 2: Brand Tone**

The internal doc says "smart friend who knows what they're talking about" - is that still accurate? And how does that compare to:
- monday (playful, almost childish sometimes)
- Asana (professional, almost boring)
- ClickUp (scrappy, aggressive)
- Notion (minimalist, aesthetic)

Where does TechFlow sit and what should our campaign tone feel like?

**Question 3: Lead Quality vs Quantity**

With $180K in media budget and a 500 MQL goal, we're looking at ~$360/MQL. That's actually pretty reasonable for B2B SaaS.

But we could also:
- Push for 700+ leads at lower quality
- Target 300 high-intent leads (demo requests only)
- Split between brand and performance

What matters more - hitting the 500 number or quality of leads that convert?
