# Course 1: AI Strategy & Decision Framework

**Target Audience**: C-suite executives, VPs, directors, budget approvers
**Duration**: 38-40 minutes
**Goal**: Enable strategic decision-making about AI transformation

---

## Course Overview

This course provides executives with the strategic framework needed to understand AI transformation, make informed build-vs-buy decisions, and avoid common pitfalls that waste time and create organizational resistance.

**You will learn**:
- The current AI transformation landscape and competitive urgency
- The 5 Levels of AI adoption framework
- Why most AI projects fail (the Level 3 trap) and how to avoid it
- How to distinguish ML, Agentic, and Existing Tool approaches
- What makes AI truly "agentic" and how to evaluate vendor claims
- The three categories of agentic solutions and their ROI ranges

---

## Module Sequence

### **[Module 01: AI State & Opportunity](./01_ai_state_opportunity/module.md)** (5 min)

**What you'll learn**: Why AI transformation is happening now, but execution quality (not use case choice) determines ROI. Poor implementation creates organizational resistance and capability debt.

**Key takeaway**: Real transformation is rare and concentrated. Competitive advantage lies in systematic implementation, not rushing to adopt.

---

### **[Module 02: The 5 Levels of AI Adoption](./02_five_levels_framework/information.md)** (12-14 min)

**What you'll learn**: The complete framework from Individual AI → Generic SaaS → No-Code Automation → Iterative Agents → Autonomous. Deep dive into why Level 3 fails (failure timeline, iteration economics, organizational resistance) and why Level 4 succeeds (rapid feedback loops).

**Real examples**: [Level 3 vs Level 4 Use-Cases](./02_five_levels_framework/use_cases_level_3_to_4.md) - Detailed comparisons across HR, Support, and Sales scenarios

**Key takeaway**: Transformation happens at Level 4-5, not 1-3. The Level 3 trap wastes money (-$30K/year) and creates 12-18 months of AI skepticism. Skip to Level 4 with rapid iteration capability.

---

### **[Module 03: ML vs Agentic Principles](./03_ml_vs_agentic/module.md)** (10-12 min)

**What you'll learn**: Critical distinction between three approaches:
- **ML**: Data-driven predictions (forecasting, classification, pattern recognition)
- **Custom Agentic AI**: Instruction-driven reasoning with company context
- **Existing AI Tools**: Pre-built solutions (now including tools like Notion AI, Copilot that can access your data)

Updated decision framework: It's not just "do I need my data?" but "do I need MORE than basic data access?"

**Includes**: [Quiz 1 - ML vs Agentic Scenarios](./03_ml_vs_agentic/quiz.md)

**Key takeaway**: Understand which approach fits which problem. Context engineering advantage of custom builds vs cost-timeline trade-offs.

---

### **[Module 03b: Understanding AI Agents (Conceptual)](./03b_understanding_agents_level35/module.md)** (4-5 min)

**What you'll learn**: Foundational understanding of what makes AI "agentic":
- **LLM** (brain): Understanding and reasoning
- **Tools** (hands): Taking actions
- **Memory** (notebook): Maintaining context
- **Autonomy** (compass): Working toward goals

The agentic spectrum from chat to multi-agent orchestration. Strategic evaluation framework for assessing vendor claims.

**Key takeaway**: True agentic AI requires all four components + rapid iteration capability to reach reliability. This knowledge protects you from the Level 3 trap and enables informed vendor evaluation.

---

### **[Module 04: Agentic Solution Categories](./04_agentic_categories/module.md)** (5 min)

**What you'll learn**: Three categories with real ROI data:
- **Static Information Chatbots** (Level 4, $15K-$99K/year): Answer from existing knowledge
- **Dynamic Content Chatbots** (Level 4-5, $14K-$246K/year): Fetch real-time data
- **Custom Workflows & Analyzers** (Level 5, $63K-$158K/year): Apply expert judgment at scale

Category selection guide and real examples.

**Key takeaway**: Understand what you can build, expected ROI ranges, and when to use each category to identify your high-value opportunities.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, you will be able to:

✓ **Assess your organization's current AI maturity** using the 5 Levels framework
✓ **Recognize and avoid the Level 3 trap** that causes most AI project failures
✓ **Distinguish between ML, Agentic, and Existing Tool approaches** and know when to use each
✓ **Evaluate vendor "AI agent" claims** using the 4-component framework (LLM, Tools, Memory, Autonomy)
✓ **Understand iteration economics** - why Level 4 (10-20 cycles/day) succeeds where Level 3 (1-2 cycles/month) fails
✓ **Identify high-value use cases** across the three agentic solution categories
✓ **Make informed build-vs-buy decisions** based on integration depth needs and organizational capability
✓ **Approve AI transformation initiatives** with realistic budgets, timelines, and success criteria

## Course Philosophy

This is **principles-based education**, not just use case showcases. You'll learn:
- **Why** things work or fail (not just what to do)
- **How to think** about AI transformation (not just templates to copy)
- **What questions to ask** when evaluating solutions (not just vendor checklist)

**The goal**: Enable you to make strategic decisions confidently, even as AI technology evolves.

## Start Learning

**→ Begin with [Module 01: AI State & Opportunity](./01_ai_state_opportunity/module.md)**

Follow the sequence: 01 → 02 → 03 → 03b → 04

Each module builds on the previous one, creating a coherent mental model for AI transformation strategy.
