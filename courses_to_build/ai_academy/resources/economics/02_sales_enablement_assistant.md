## The Challenge

Sales reps waste hours searching for the right playbook, pricing information, competitive positioning, and best practices. Information is scattered across Google Docs, Slack threads, and sales leadership's minds. New reps take months to ramp, and experienced reps struggle to stay current with product updates.

### Pain Points:
- **For Sales Reps:** Time wasted searching, missed opportunities due to wrong info
- **For Sales Leadership:** Repetitive questions, inconsistent messaging in market
- **For Product/Marketing:** Sales doesn't use latest messaging or materials
- **For Company:** Lost deals due to slow response or incorrect information

**Sales reps spend 5 hours/month searching for information:**
- Digging through Google Drive for playbooks
- Asking colleagues "how do we handle X objection?"
- Waiting for leadership to clarify pricing questions

**Sales leadership spends hours answering repetitive questions:**
- "What's our discount policy for enterprise?"
- "How do we position against Competitor X?"
- "Where's the ROI calculator?"
- "What's the latest on Feature Y?"
