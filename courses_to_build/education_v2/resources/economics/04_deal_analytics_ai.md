## Before: Current State

### Manual Process

**10 sales reps spend 9 hours/week each:**
- Searching CRM for client history
- Reading email threads to understand context
- Updating CRM fields manually
- Creating pipeline reports for managers
- Looking up past quotes and proposals

| CRM data entry | 3 hours | 30 hours | $60 | $1,800 |
| Information search | 4 hours | 40 hours | $60 | $2,400 |
| Reporting | 2 hours | 20 hours | $60 | $1,200 |
