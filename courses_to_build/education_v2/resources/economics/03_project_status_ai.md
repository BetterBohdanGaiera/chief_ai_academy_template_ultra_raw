# Project Status AI Assistant - Economic Analysis

**Department:** Product / Engineering / Project Management
**AI Maturity Level:** Level 4-5 (Custom Agents + Human-in-the-Loop → Autonomous)
**Integration Type:** Dynamic Chatbot with Real-Time Data
**Tools Used:** Claude, Jira MCP, GitHub MCP, Confluence MCP, Slack Integration

---

## The Challenge

Project managers spend hours compiling status updates from multiple systems (Jira, GitHub, Confluence). Stakeholders constantly interrupt with "What's the status of X?" Engineering teams waste time in status meetings instead of building. Information is always slightly outdated.

---

## Before: Current State

### The Manual Process

**5 Project Managers spend 7 hours/week each:**
- Checking Jira for sprint progress
- Reviewing GitHub for PR status and blockers
- Reading Confluence for technical decisions
- Preparing status reports
- Answering ad-hoc Slack questions
- Running status meetings

### Time Investment

| Activity | Hours/Week per PM | Total (5 PMs) | Hourly Rate | Weekly Cost |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Status compilation | 3 hours | 15 hours | $70 | $1,050 |
| Meetings | 2 hours | 10 hours | $70 | $700 |
| Ad-hoc questions | 2 hours | 10 hours | $70 | $700 |
| **Total** | **7 hours** | **35 hours** | - | **$2,450/week** |

**Monthly cost:** $2,450 × 4 = **$9,800/month**
**Annual cost:** $9,800 × 12 = **$117,600/year**

## After: AI-Powered State

### The Automated System

**AI agent provides instant status updates:**
- "What's blocking the authentication epic?"
- "Which PRs are waiting for review?"
- "What's behind schedule this sprint?"
- "Show me all P0 bugs assigned to Backend team"

**Proactive alerts:**
- Notifies when tasks go stale
- Highlights blockers before daily standup
- Summarizes sprint progress Friday afternoons

### Time Investment with AI

| Activity | Hours/Week per PM | Total (5 PMs) | Hourly Rate | Weekly Cost |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Reviewing AI summaries | 1 hour | 5 hours | $70 | $350 |
| Strategic planning | 1 hour | 5 hours | $70 | $350 |
| AI operating costs | - | - | - | $125 |
| **Total** | **2 hours** | **10 hours** | - | **$825/week** |

**Monthly cost:** $825 × 4 = **$3,300/month**
**Annual cost:** $3,300 × 12 = **$39,600/year**

## Economic Analysis

### Direct Savings

**Annual time savings:**
$117,600 - $39,600 = **$78,000/year**

---

### Additional Benefits (Quantified)

#### 1. Reduced Status Meetings
**Before:** 5 status meetings/week × 8 attendees × 1 hour = 40 hours
**After:** 1 status meeting/week × 8 attendees × 0.5 hours = 4 hours
**Savings:** 36 hours/week × $60 average rate = $2,160/week = **$112,320/year**

#### 2. Engineering Velocity Improvement
**Time freed for engineers:** 36 hours/week
**Average engineering team:** 30 engineers
**Individual time saved:** ~1.2 hours/week per engineer
**Productivity gain:** 1.2 hours × 30 engineers × 48 weeks × $80/hour = **$138,240/year**
*Conservative estimate (25% capture):* **$34,560/year**

#### 3. Faster Decision Making
**Reduced time to identify blockers:** 2 days → 2 hours
**Average cost of delay:** $5,000/day per blocked initiative
**Blocked initiatives prevented:** 12/year
**Savings:** 12 × 2 days × $5,000 = **$120,000/year**
*Conservative estimate (20% capture):* **$24,000/year**
