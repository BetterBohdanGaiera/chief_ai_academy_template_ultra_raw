# Learning Path: Executive

**Target Audience:** C-suite executives, VP-level leaders, board members
**Total Time:** ~70 minutes
**Goal:** Understand AI transformation strategy, organizational requirements, and decision frameworks for AI adoption

---

## Why This Path

As an executive, you need to:
- Understand the strategic landscape of AI transformation (not just technical details)
- Make informed build-vs-buy decisions
- Assess organizational readiness and required team structure
- Evaluate vendor claims and solution proposals
- Set realistic expectations for timelines and ROI

This path focuses on **strategic understanding** without implementation details.

## Your Learning Journey

### Module 1: F1 - Five Levels Framework (20 min)

**Why take this:** Foundation for all strategic decisions

**What you'll learn:**
- The 5 levels of AI adoption (Individual AI → Autonomous Agents)
- Why Level 3 is a trap (65-75% reliability → abandonment)
- What defines Level 4 (rapid iteration: 1-3 cycles/day, 20 total over 2-3 weeks)
- Iteration economics as the primary differentiator
- Realistic path from current state to Level 4

**Key takeaway:** Success isn't about technology choice - it's about iteration speed. Internal teams beat external agencies because they can iterate daily, not monthly.

**Strategic value:** You'll stop falling for vendor promises and start asking the right questions about iteration capability.

### Module 2: F2 - Organization Structure (18 min)

**Why take this:** Understand WHO makes transformation happen

**What you'll learn:**
- Four key roles: Chief AI Officer, AI Champions, Agent Managers, AI Agent Developers
- Why the Agent Manager role is critical (domain experts who document processes)
- How Agent Manager + Developer partnership enables rapid iteration (Level 4 defining structure)
- Real implementation stories: HR, Sales, Operations showing 20 iteration patterns over 2-3 weeks
- Transformation process: 3 phases, realistic timelines, budget requirements
- Team sizing requirements for different scales

**Key takeaway:** You don't need to hire AI experts for every department. Promote domain experts to Agent Managers and pair them with Developers.

**Strategic value:** You can now plan headcount, budget, and organizational changes required for transformation.

### Module 3: S1 - Choosing AI Technology (18 min)

**Why take this:** Make informed build-vs-buy decisions

**What you'll learn:**
- Four AI approaches: Machine Learning, Custom Agentic AI, Existing Tools (with/without data access), No AI
- When to use each approach with real examples
- Why context engineering gives custom builds advanced control (model quality, retrieval logic, interfaces, capabilities)
- Three Agentic solution categories with ROI ranges ($15K-$246K/year)
- Decision framework: When existing tools are sufficient vs when custom builds are necessary

**Key takeaway:** Many existing tools NOW can access your data (Notion AI, Copilot) - but custom gives you control over models, capabilities, interfaces, and retrieval logic that existing tools can't match.

**Strategic value:** You'll know exactly when to build custom vs use existing tools, avoiding both over-investment and missed opportunities.

---

### Optional: S2 - Understanding Agents (12 min)

**Why take this:** Evaluate vendor claims about "AI agents"

**What you'll learn:**
- Four components of agents: LLM (brain), Tools (hands), Memory (notebook), Autonomy (compass)
- The agentic spectrum from chat to multi-agent orchestration
- How to evaluate if solutions are truly "agentic" (component checklist)
- Red flags in vendor claims vs green flags for real agentic systems
- Limitations of current AI agents

**Key takeaway:** Not all "AI agents" are created equal. Missing components = missing capabilities.

**Strategic value:** You can now critically evaluate vendor solutions and ask informed questions in demos.

---

### Optional: S3 Overview - Managing AI (Skim: 10 min)

**Note:** Full module is 25 minutes and implementation-focused. As executive, skim these sections:

**Section 1: The Management Shift (5 min)**
- Understand the reframe: managing people → managing people + managing AI
- Success factors: understanding capabilities, empathy for limitations, clear communication, quality standards, iteration discipline

**Section 3: Context Engineering Overview (3 min)**
- Understand it's the critical work (not technical, but process documentation)
- 5-step methodology exists
- Front-loaded work that pays off continuously

**Section 6: What Non-Tech Teams Can Do (2 min)**
- Level 3.5 tools (Cursor, Claude Code) enable domain experts to prototype
- Understand when to involve developers vs what Agent Managers can build

**Key takeaway:** Context engineering is the actual work of transformation - documenting processes so AI can execute them. It's not a technical skill.

**Strategic value:** You understand what your Agent Managers will be doing and why it's critical work.

## What You Can Do After This Path

**Strategic Decisions:**
- ✅ Evaluate build-vs-buy for specific use cases using decision framework from S1
- ✅ Assess whether vendor "AI agent" claims are legitimate (S2 component checklist)
- ✅ Determine if your organization has Level 4 structure (internal iteration capability)
- ✅ Identify which departments are ready for AI transformation

**Organizational Planning:**
- ✅ Plan team composition (how many AI Champions, Agent Managers, Developers)
- ✅ Budget for realistic transformation (F2 budget guidance)
- ✅ Set timeline expectations (2-3 weeks to production-ready with Level 4 structure)
- ✅ Decide whether to hire external or promote internal for Agent Manager roles

**Communication:**
- ✅ Explain to board why internal teams are necessary (iteration economics)
- ✅ Push back on vendor claims about "6-week implementations" without iteration details
- ✅ Set realistic expectations with stakeholders about accuracy progression (70% → 95% through iterations)

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Assess current state:** Which level is your organization at? (Likely Level 1-2)
2. **Identify pilot department:** HR, Sales, or Operations for first transformation
3. **Evaluate iteration capability:** Do you have co-located team or external agency dependency?
4. **Plan structure:** Do you need to hire AI Champion? Promote Agent Managers? Hire Developer?

**Within 30 Days:**
1. **Choose first use case:** Apply S1 decision framework to pick build vs buy
2. **Budget approval:** Use F2 guidance for realistic budget and timeline
3. **Identify Agent Manager candidate:** Domain expert in pilot department
4. **Evaluate vendors:** If buying existing tools, use S2 component checklist

**Within 90 Days:**
1. **Launch pilot:** Start with one department, one use case
2. **Measure iterations:** Track feedback cycles per day (targeting 1-3 during active development)
3. **Document learnings:** What context was missing? What took longer than expected?
4. **Plan scale:** If pilot succeeds, identify next 2-3 departments

## Common Executive Questions

**Q: Should I hire an AI consultant or build internal team?**

A: Build internal team (Agent Managers + Developers). Consultants can't iterate rapidly (1 cycle/week vs 1-3/day). You'll hit the Level 3 trap - 5+ months → 65-75% reliability → abandoned. See F1 for iteration economics.

**Q: How much should I budget for first AI transformation initiative?**

A: $100K-$500K for custom build depending on complexity. Includes: 30% technical build, 35% process documentation, 35% context engineering. Timeline: 2-4 months. See F2 for team sizing and S1 for solution categories with ROI ranges.

**Q: Can we just use Notion AI / Microsoft Copilot / Salesforce Einstein?**

A: Depends on your needs. These tools CAN access your data BUT are limited by:
- Vendor's model choice (often cheaper LLMs)
- Basic capabilities (simple Q&A, no reflection/verification)
- Their interface (can't deploy as Slackbot if team lives in Slack)
- Their roadmap (not yours)

Use S1 decision framework: Check the four limitation factors (interface, model quality, capabilities, features). If all acceptable → use existing tool. If any insufficient → consider custom build.

**Q: What's a realistic timeline to reach 95%+ reliability?**

A: With Level 4 structure (internal team, rapid iteration):
- 2-3 weeks to production-ready (20 iterations at 1-3/day)
- Start at 70-85% accuracy
- Reach 95%+ through feedback loops

With Level 3 approach (external agency, slow iteration):
- 6 months → Still not production-ready → Often abandoned
- Stuck at 70% because only 12-24 total iterations possible

See F1 for iteration economics breakdown.

**Q: Do I need AI experts or can I promote from within?**

A: Promote domain experts to Agent Managers. They know the processes deeply - they just need to learn to document for AI consumption (not a technical skill). Hire 1-2 Developers who understand AI architecture. See F2 for role definitions and team composition.

**Q: How do I know if a vendor solution is truly "agentic"?**

A: Use S2 component checklist:
- ✓ LLM (which model? Latest generation?)
- ✓ Tools (what can it actually DO beyond chat?)
- ✓ Memory (maintains context across interactions?)
- ✓ Autonomy (breaks down goals, self-corrects?)

Also ask:
- How do we iterate when outputs aren't right? (daily or monthly?)
- Who controls iteration - us or you?
- What's the path to 95%+ reliability? (need 20 iterations over 2-3 weeks)

Red flags: "AI-powered" with no clear tools, "automation" that's manual execution, "custom" with slow iteration cycles.
